**variables_if_else_while

This folder contains introductory exercises on variables, if, else, and while statements in C. The assignments are designed to build understanding of control flow, conditionals, and basic logic as foundational skills for C programming.

Files included
0-positive_or_negative.c: Assigns a random number to a variable and prints if it is positive, negative, or zero.

1-last_digit.c: Prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and provides additional info about it.

2-print_alphabet.c: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

3-print_alphabets.c: Prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase, new line after each.

4-print_alphabt.c: Prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for 'q' and 'e'.

5-print_numbers.c: Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

6-print_numberz.c: Prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using only putchar.

7-print_tebahpla.c: Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.

8-print_base16.c: Prints all hexadecimal numbers in lowercase.

9-print_comb.c: Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by ", ".
