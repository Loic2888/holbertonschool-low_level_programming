**pointers_arrays_strings

This folder contains exercises on manipulating pointers, arrays, and strings in C. The assignments are designed to deepen understanding of how data is stored, accessed, and modified using pointers, and how strings and arrays are handled in low-level programming.

Files included
0-memset.c: Function that fills memory with a constant byte.

0-reset_to_98.c: Function that updates the value of a pointer to 98.

0-strcat.c: Function that concatenates two strings.

1-memcpy.c: Function that copies memory area.

1-strncat.c: Function that concatenates two strings with security.

1-swap.c: Function that swaps the values of two integers.

100-atoi.c: Function that converts a string to an integer.

2-strchr.c: Function that locates a character in a string.

2-strlen.c: Function that returns the length of a string.

2-strncpy.c: Function that copies a string (like strncpy).

3-puts.c: Function that prints a string to stdout.

3-strcmp.c: Function that compares two strings.

3-strspn.c: Function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

4-print_rev.c: Function that prints a string in reverse.

4-rev_array.c: Function that reverses an array of integers.

4-strpbrk.c: Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

5-rev_string.c: Function that reverses a string.

5-string_toupper.c: Function that changes lowercase letters to uppercase in a string.

5-strstr.c: Function that locates a substring.

6-cap_string.c: Function that capitalizes all words in a string.

6-puts2.c: Function that prints every other character of a string.

7-leet.c: Function that encodes a string into "1337".

7-print_chessboard.c: Function that prints the chessboard.

7-puts_half.c: Function that prints half of a string.

8-print_array.c: Function that prints elements of an array of integers.

8-print_diagsums.c: Function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix.

9-strcpy.c: Function that copies a string.

_putchar.c: Auxiliary output function.

main.h: Header file with prototypes.

README.md: This file.

Various main.c files: Test files for different functions.

Compilation
Compile any file with:

bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic <filename>.c -o <executable_name>
Example:

bash
