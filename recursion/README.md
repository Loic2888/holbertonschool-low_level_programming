**recursion

This folder contains C programming exercises focused on recursive functions. The assignments are designed to provide practice with recursion, a fundamental concept where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.

Files included
0-puts_recursion.c: Function that prints a string, using recursion.

1-print_rev_recursion.c: Function that prints a string in reverse, recursively.

2-strlen_recursion.c: Function that returns the length of a string, recursively.

3-factorial.c: Function that computes the factorial of a number using recursion.

4-pow_recursion.c: Function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y, recursively.

5-sqrt_recursion.c: Function that calculates the natural square root of a number using recursion.

6-is_prime_number.c: Function that checks if an integer is a prime number, recursively.

main.h: Header file with function prototypes.

README.md: This file.

4-main.c: Test file for pow_recursion.

Compilation
To compile a file, use:

bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic <filename>.c -o <executable_name>
Example:

bash
gcc 3-factorial.c -o factorial
Learning objectives
Understand how recursion works in C programming.

Break problems into smaller subproblems and solve them using recursive calls.

Practice writing base cases and recursive cases for different algorithms.
