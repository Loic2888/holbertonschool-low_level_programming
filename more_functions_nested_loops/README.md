**more_functions_nested_loops

This folder contains a set of C programming exercises that focus on creating more advanced functions and using nested loops for various patterns and calculations. The tasks here build on previous knowledge and introduce new logical challenges with conditions and repeated statements.

Files included
0-isupper.c: Checks if a character is uppercase.

1-isdigit.c: Checks if a character is a digit (0-9).

2-mul.c: Multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c: Prints the numbers from 0 to 9.

4-print_most_numbers.c: Prints the numbers 0 to 9, except 2 and 4.

5-more_numbers.c: Prints the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times.

6-print_line.c: Draws a straight line in the terminal.

7-print_diagonal.c: Draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8-print_square.c: Prints a square using the # character.

9-fizz_buzz.c: Prints the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 100.

10-print_triangle.c: Prints a triangle using the # character.

main.h: Header file with prototypes for all functions.

Several main.c files: Test files for running corresponding functions.

README.md: This file.

Compilation
To compile a file, use:

bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic <filename>.c -o <executable_name>
Example:

bash
gcc 0-isupper.c -o isupper
