**holbertonschool-low_level_programming

This repository contains all the practical assignments completed as part of the C - low level programming curriculum at Holberton School. Its objective is to provide a progressive introduction to fundamental concepts of the C language through function creation, pointers, dynamic memory management, and more.

Project Structure
Each folder corresponds to a specific module or topic related to learning C:

argc_argv: Handling command-line arguments (argc, argv), creating command-line scripts.

function_pointers: Introduction to function pointers and their usage in various contexts.

functions_nested_loops: Creating and using functions, nested loops, flow control.

hello_world: First steps in C, compiling, basic output (printf, puts, etc.).

malloc_free: Dynamic memory allocation, management and freeing memory with malloc and free.

more_functions_nested_loops: Advanced functions and loops.

more_malloc_free: Additional practice on dynamic memory allocation.

pointers_arrays_strings: Advanced manipulation of pointers, arrays, and strings.

recursion: Discovering and implementing recursion in C.

structures_typedef: Structures and custom types using typedef.

variables_if_else_while: Working with variables and control structures (if, else, while).

variadic_functions: Functions with a variable number of arguments.

Usage
Each folder contains:

The .c source files

The required header files

A specific README when applicable

Compilation or test scripts when needed

To compile a folder, navigate to the relevant directory and use gcc:

bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic source_file.c -o executable
Learning Objectives
Master writing idiomatic C functions

Understand low-level memory management

Explore advanced concepts like pointers and recursion

Manipulate simple data structures
