**functions_nested_loops

This folder contains C programming exercises focusing on functions and nested loops. The goal of these assignments is to develop a correct understanding of function creation, reusability, and controlling program flow with nested loops.

Compilation
To compile one of the source files, use:

bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic <filename>.c -o <executable_name>
Example:

bash
gcc 4-isalpha.c -o isalpha
Learning objectives
Write simple and reusable functions in C.

Understand and implement nested loops for repeated actions.

Control program flow with custom logic.

Improve debugging and modularity of code.
